Project TODO
-  3rd picture for textur
- fix fresenel
- make graph of rendering times for threading
- make gallery of additional features
- do write up
- make final scene
- bump mapping
- tone mapping


Done 
- Added square light (soft shadows by monte carlo estimation)
- control ss level from render command
- set_texture_map
- changed it to look_at
- uv mapping for meshes
- sky map
- plane primitive
- frsenel
- menger sponge
- multithreading

Final Scene Idea
- Desk with pointer (normal) and foam apple.. something else? golf ball, chair, projector

I was using this colour space transform for a couple of days, until my esteemed colleague Miles pointed out that I was doing it wrong. A much simpler approach is to calculate your luminance directly from the RGB values, perform the tone mapping on this value and then scale the original RGB values appropriately:

double L = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B;
double nL = ToneMap(L);
double scale = nL / L;
R *= scale;
G *= scale;
B *= scale;
